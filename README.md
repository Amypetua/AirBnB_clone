# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
This repository contains solutions to the Alx Airbnb team project.

# what is Airbnb?
Airbnb is a popular online marketplace that enables people to rent out their home, apartments, or other forms of lodging to travellers. It was founded in 2008 and has since grown into a globalplatform with over 7 millions listings in more than 220 countries and regions.

# what is Airbnb clone?
Airbnb clone is a web or mobile application that replicates the core features and functionalities of the Airbnb platform. This includes features such as allowing hosts to list and rent out properties. Many developers create Airbnb clones as a way to learn web development or to provide a similar service for different market or niche.

# what is the Airbnb clone team project all about?
For this Alx team project we are building a simple copy of the Airbnb  website. The web applicatiion won't have all the features of the Airbnb but some of the features. This project will be completed in 4 months and it will be composed of the following;
1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging.
2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: web static and web dynamic.
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them).

# what is command interpreter
Command interpreters are computer programs that provides a user interface to interact with an operating system or execute commands. They are often called shells with the most popular ones for linux and unix-based systems the Bourne Again SHell (BASH) and the z SHell (zSH). These shells allows users to enter commands, execute scripts and run various programs and utilities
In addition to executing commands, command interpreters also provides a range of features and functions such as command history, command line editing, job control and file completion among others.
But in our project we are running our codes using python script instead of shell script.
The "cmd" module in python which provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreter will be used in this project. The "cmd" can easily create an interactive shell for python application, where users can enter commands and receive output.
